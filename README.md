# Kisaan-Help-Desk
**A simple machine learning based website which provides details of soil testing centres in India,recommends best crop to grow, fertilizers to use and the diseases caught by your crops**  
# About Me 
Greetings Everyone,  
I'm Shekhar Boppanapally from B V raju institute of technology,narsapur,medak,telangana  
If you have any doubt or want to contribute feel free to connect  me up on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shekhar-boppanapally-647a281bb/)
# Aim Of Project
->Our country is an Agricultural land  
->60% of the peoplr belongs to agricultural background    
->Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a countryâ€™s economic growth.  
->Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield.  
# Services 
**1.Soil Testing Centres**      
->Here i provided all the soil testing centres available in India.So that farmers can easily go to their nearest soil testing centre to test their siol  
**2.Crop Recommendation**    
->In the crop recommendation application, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.  
**3.Ferilizer Recommendation**    
->For the fertilizer recommendation application, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has excess of and will recommend improvements.  
**4.Crop Disease Prediction**    
->The user can select their crop and input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.  

# How to Use  
**1.Soil Testing Centres**:-You need to select your state first then after submitting it you need to choose your district then you will get all the soil testing centres available in your district.You can choose your nearest soil testing Centre today to test your soil  
**2.Crop Recommendation**:-You need to enter the corresponding nutrient(N,P,K,Ph,rainfall,humidity and temperature) values of your soil then after submitting it you will get the recommended crop to grow in your farm  
**3.Fertilizer recommendation**:-Enter the nutrient contents of your soil and the crop you want to grow. The algorithm will tell which nutrient the soil has excess of or lacks. Accordingly, it will give suggestions for buying fertilizers.  
**4.Crop Disease Prediction**:- Upload an image of leaf of your plant. The algorithm will tell the crop type and whether it is diseased or healthy. If it is diseased, it will tell you the cause of the disease and suggest you how to prevent/cure the disease accordingly

# Future Improvements  
This was my first big project so there are lot of things to improve upon  
=>CSS code is totally messed up ðŸ˜”  
=>Frontend can be made more nicer (I suck at frontend development) ðŸ˜¢    
=>Additional plant images can be collected to make the disease detection part more robust and generalized ðŸ¤•  
=>Trying to add Crop yeild predictionðŸ˜•
